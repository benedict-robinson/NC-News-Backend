# Northcoders News API

For reimplementation of this repo on a local machine, installation of 'dotenv' will be required and two files, .env.test and .env.development, will need to be made to seed data into the nc_news_test and nc_news databases respectively.

Additionally, "jest" and "supertest" must be required to run the test suites, "pg" and "pg-format" must be install to seed data, and "express" must be installed to enable the running of the server.
